Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree Movie Trailer Project

This is the first project in the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree.  
I created the python code in media.py and entertainment_center.py based on course material which involved
learning the basic syntax for Python classes and inheritance.  I also slightly edited the fresh_tomatoes.py
code to incude the storylines on the webpage.
