Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree Movie Trailer Project

This is the first project in the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree.
I created the python code in media.py and entertainment_center.py based on course material which 
involved learning the basic syntax for Python classes and inheritance. I also slightly edited the 
fresh_tomatoes.py code to incude the storylines on the webpage.

TO THE REVIEWER:
You can view the page created via the python code at https://markhorvath.github.io/fsnd-movietrailer/.

Or you can clone this repository and run entertainment_center.py in the shell of your choice.
